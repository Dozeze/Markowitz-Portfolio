# Markowitz-Portfolio

## Formulation
A fraction $x_j$ of our total capital is to be invested in some assets $j$, where $j = 1,2,...,n$. We model the return of each assets as a ranbom variable $\zeta_j$. We assume that the expected value $\mathbb{E}[\zeta_j] = \mu_j$, and our covariance matrix $C_{ij} = \mathbb{E}[(\zeta_i - mu_i)(\zeta_j - mu_j)]$ are known, where $i,j = 1,2,...,n$.
